            <h3>A Chance Meeting</h3>
          </div>

          <p>At Tomorrowland, Timofey met Christian Pedersen through a mutual friend, and their conversation quickly turned to their shared passions: music, technology, and efficiency. Christian, with over 30 years of experience and a track record of more than 500 successful projects, was the perfect partner. With a deep understanding of electronics and user-focused design, Christian knew how to take Timofeyâ€™s ideas and turn them into something real.</p>
          <p>Together, they formed Sound Rogue, and the first product to emerge from this collaboration was the MIDI-9.</p>
