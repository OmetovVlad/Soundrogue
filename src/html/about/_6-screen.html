            <h3>Why We’re Here — and Why We Need Your Help</h3>
          </div>

          <p>Sound Rogue is about creating tools that help you work better, without the fuss. The MIDI-9 is our first step in that direction, and we’re excited to share it with you. We’ve spent countless hours in the studio, testing and refining, to make sure it’s something you’ll actually want to use — day in and day out.</p>
          <p>Now, we need your support to take the MIDI-9 from a working prototype to full production. With your backing, we can bring this practical, reliable tool to studios around the world and help producers everywhere work more efficiently.</p>
          <p>We know that the best gear is the kind you don’t have to think about. It just works. And that’s what we’ve built with the MIDI-9.</p>
