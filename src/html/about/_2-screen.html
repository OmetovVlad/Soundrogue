            <h3>Sound Rogue — Crafting Tools That Fit Perfectly</h3>
          </div>

          <p>At Sound Rogue, we believe that the best studio gear should make life easier without getting in the way. That’s why we’ve created the MIDI-9, a tool designed to blend seamlessly into your studio workflow, helping you focus on what matters most — your music.</p>
          <p>Founded by Timofey, a veteran music producer, and Christian Pedersen, an experienced engineer, Sound Rogue is all about creating products that feel natural, are built to last, and solve real-world problems in professional studios. We’re not here to make grand claims; we’re here to make gear that works better, simply and efficiently.</p>
